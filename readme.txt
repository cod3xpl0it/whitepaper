Latex Template Version 5

Guideline How to Setup the Latex Files
======================================
To use the J.UCS LaTeX template it is necessary to download both, the template and the LaTeX style document (jucs2e.sty). 
The template file will load the style document which contains all instructions regarding layout and style. The style will 
be loaded automatically (package is included in the template) as long as both files are located in the same directory.

Requires Files
==============
jucs2e.sty
J.UCS Article Template V5.tex
